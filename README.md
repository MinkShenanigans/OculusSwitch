OculusSwitch

A program that switches the OVRService on and off.

Usage:
Opening the program will prompt for admin permissions, as this is needed to access SC Manager (services), if valid admin credentials are given,
the program will open a command line window for a split second before closing it.

If you wish to see the output of the program, run it via command line, outputs will show if it has succeeded in turning the service on / off.
